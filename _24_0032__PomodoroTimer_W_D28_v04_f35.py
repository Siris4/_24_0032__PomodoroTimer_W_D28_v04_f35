window = Tk()  #either get ahold of the tkinter Module, then the Tk() Class, OR if using a lot of Classes (which we will be doing in this program), then we will just use the .Tk() Class from importing tkinter
#set the title of the window:
window.title("Pomodoro")
window.config(padx=100, pady=50, bg=YELLOW)   #this ACTUALLY ADDS to the original width and height of the original 421x518 window. It won't take AWAY, or keep it the same size, it ADDS to the x and y lengths. So (padx=40, pady=40) would be a total window size of 461x558 pixels.  # https://colorhunt.co/palette/ebe76cf0b86eed7b7b836096 for bg=background_color_of_choice (without using "", because )

fg=GREEN #foreground

canvas = Canvas(width=430, height=496, bg=YELLOW, highlightthickness=0)  #variable canvas is created from the Canvas Widget  # width and height ar in pixel. # bg=background_color_for_canvas (not using "", since YELLOW is a variable name.  # highlightthickness=0 will get rid of the white line.

#Grid layout will be 3 columns wide and 5 rows down:

# Timer label:
timer_label = Label(text="This is old text", fg=GREEN, bg=YELLOW, font=("Arial", 36, 'bold')) #color=GREEN
timer_label.config(text="Timer")

canvas.create_image(215, 248, image=tomato_img)  #add my image to it, x and y (which are implied, inside) is needed in the (). Because we want the image to be placed right in the center of the window, we divide the dimensions in half, for both, and place those numbers in the paren(). #Also add the image=(PhotoImage datatype Class of tkinter), in order to read through a file and get ahold of a photo at a certain location. Also add the variable after the 'image=' part.
